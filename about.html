        <h1>About</h1>
        <section class="introduction-section">
          <p>I am a young introvert who enjoys to learn and create things. I'm married with two kids and I love being a father and husband. Life is never dull with a family!</p>
          <p>I value community and education very strongly. There is nothing I like more than to see people develop and find where they can fit in and contribute to a community.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="location-section">
          <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
          <p>I am from nowhere in particular. I've moved with my family 11 times with a final 12th move to Warsaw, Indiana for college. I've been here ever since.</p>

          <h1>More About Me</h1>
          <h2>What are your favorite hobbies?</h2>
          <p>My favorite hobbies are learning, reading, and creating things.</p>
          <h2>What is your dream job?</h2>
          <p>My dream job as of now is to be a Web Developer.</p>
          <h2>What is your background?</h2>
          <p>I've always enjoyed working with computers, although I never knew what programming was growing up. I remember trying to set up custom layouts on my Myspace page and trying to embed images and apps. I even thought it would be interesting to build my own webpage when I found out that that was something that could be done. Even with that I never thought I would want to be a web developer, and I didn't even give it a chance until I stumbled upon it at CodeAcademy while trying to learn programming so that I could become a game developer. That's where I fell in love with web development and what has ultimately lead me to where I am now.</p>
          <h2>What music have you been listening to lately?</h2>
          <p>Lately I've been listening to my paramore/flyleaf pandora station. So throw in a bit of Deas Vail, Future of Forestry, and a few other alternative bands.</p>
